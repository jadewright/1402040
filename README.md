Demonstrated, is a simulation of Agent Based Modeling.
In this program, users are prompted to enter the number of agents and a preferred (x, y) coordinate for each agent. 
Each agent in this simulation is placed at a specific (x, y) coordinate on a two-dimensional grid. 

The coordinates represent positions on the grid.
The simulation involves agents moving within this grid based on their preferences, with randomness introduced at 20%.
As the simulation progresses, we can observe how agents move and interact over time as emergent patterns and behaviors form.
This simulates the unpredictable nature of real-world systems.
And provides a simple example of risk-mitigation using computational modelling.
